      h5 Support
      p The support that Rackspace offers is second to none. There is a redundancy of support and knowledge that runs throughout Rackspace. A Racker with a headset is someone who is empowered to direct a problem toward the right solution.

      h5 Collaboration
      p Groups of two or more Rackers working together shows the chemistry and commitment to solving problems and providing support. For every Racker on the phone with a customer, there is a group working together behind the scenes crafting a solution.

        li One Racker within a group looking toward the camera helps the viewer feel engaged at the ground level.
        li Solo Racker photos can be candid or staged, but should still feel authentic, capturing natural emotions.
        li Outside of showing scale, photos should aim to capture emotions. We should feel close enough to a Racker to feel a connection to what they are thinking, what problem they are solving, or simply a bit about their personality.
